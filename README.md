# Mysolutions

<u>Background:</u>

Doesn't include several Programming Projects, which, will be included at a later date. Code could also be improved for some of the projects. The repository will be updated as I work through the book, and improvements made on subsequent iterations. Folders and files to be re-organised upon first revision. This repository is, mainly, intended for the purposes of self-documentation

I claim no ownership over the book or any material contained there within. The problem/project contexts are quoted directly from the book, with some variation in wording in some cases. Please see 'Notice.txt' file for further information.

Originally uploaded to old GitHub account Makeshiftdev-c, but was removed for some reason, approximately 5 years ago if not longer. May not include some files, will double check and add later if not.
